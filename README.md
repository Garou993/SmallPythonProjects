# Small Python Projects
### This are the most interesting, in my opinion, projects from The Big Book of Small Python Projects written by Al Sweigart <br> The book can be found [HERE](https://nostarch.com/big-book-small-python-projects)

1) ### Bagels
In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you 
must guess a secret three-digit number
based on clues. The game offers one of
the following hints in response to your guess:
“Pico” when your guess has a correct digit in the
wrong place, “Fermi” when your guess has a correct
digit in the correct place, and “Bagels” if your guess
has no correct digits. You have 10 tries to guess the
secret number.

2) ### Cho-Han
Cho-han is a dice game played in gambling
houses of feudal Japan. Two six-sided dice
are rolled in a cup, and gamblers must guess
if the sum is even (cho) or odd (han).

3) ### Collatz Sequence
The Collatz sequence, also called the 3n + 1
problem, is the simplest impossible math
problem. (But don’t worry, the program
itself is easy enough for beginners.) From a
starting number, n, follow three rules to get the next
number in the sequence:
1. If n is even, the next number n is n / 2.
2. If n is odd, the next number n is n * 3 + 1.
3. If n is 1, stop. Otherwise, repeat.

It is generally thought, but so far not mathematically proven, that
every starting number eventually terminates at 1.

4) ### Dice Roller
Dungeons & Dragons and other tabletop
role-playing games use special dice that
can have 4, 8, 10, 12, or even 20 sides. These
games also have a specific notation for indicating which dice to roll. For example, 3d6 means rolling three six-sided dice, while 1d10+2 means rolling
one ten-sided die and adding a two-point bonus to
the roll. This program simulates this dice rolling, in
case you forgot to bring your own. It can also simulate rolling dice that don’t physically exist, such as a
38-sided die.

5) ### Fibonacci
The Fibonacci sequence is a famous mathematical pattern credited to Italian mathematician Fibonacci.
The sequence begins with 0 and 1, and the next number is always the sum of the previous two numbers. 

6) ### Rock Paper Scissors
In this version of the two-player hand game
the player faces off against the computer.
You can pick either rock, paper, or scissors.
Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper
beats rock.
